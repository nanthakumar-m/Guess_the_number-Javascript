# 🔢 Guess The Number – Interactive JavaScript Game

Guess The Number is a fun and interactive web-based number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. A random number between 1 and 20 is generated, and the player must guess it with hints provided based on the input. The game keeps track of score and high score, encouraging repeated play.

This project was developed to reinforce my JavaScript fundamentals, especially focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing conditional logic for user interactions.
